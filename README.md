Sorting Algorithm Visualizer:
This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer implemented in C++. It allows users to visualize the sorting process of three different algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

Overview:
The sorting algorithm visualizer generates random data and visualizes the sorting process step by step for Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort algorithms. It provides a graphical representation of how each algorithm rearranges elements to sort the data.

Features:
Visualization of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort algorithms.
Step-by-step visualization of the sorting process.
Random data generation for sorting.

Installation:
To run the sorting algorithm visualizer, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Simply clone this repository and compile the main.cpp file using your preferred compiler.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git

cd sorting-visualizer

g++ main.cpp -o sorting

Usage:
After compiling the code, run the executable sorting. Follow the on-screen instructions to select a sorting algorithm and visualize the sorting process.

The sorting algorithm visualizer supports the following algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort
